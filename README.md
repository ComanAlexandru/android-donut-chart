# Donut üç©
`DonutProgressView` is doughnut-like graph view capable of showing multiple datasets with assignable colors. It has (configurable TBD) gap at the top, which makes it look like a gauge.

It shows sum of all dataset values and starts to scale them proportionally when cap is reached.

Readme TBD.
